# ROS Vietnam – Simulation Foundation  
`rosvn-sim-foundation`

> **A standardized, reproducible simulation foundation for ROS 2 algorithm research, education, and open-source collaboration in Vietnam.**

## 1. Overview

**ROS Vietnam Simulation Foundation** is the official baseline simulation repository of the **ROS Vietnam** community.

This repository provides a **clean, deterministic, and extensible simulation environment** for developing, testing, and benchmarking robotics algorithms using **ROS 2**.

Our goal is to eliminate fragmentation in simulation setups and enable:
- High-quality academic research
- Serious algorithm development
- Long-term open-source collaboration
- Industry-grade engineering practices

This repository is **not a tutorial collection**.  
It is a **foundation** upon which all ROS Vietnam algorithmic and research projects are built.
